            <h1>“Lewis and Harris” Photo Book </h1>
            <p>Lewis and Harris make up the largest
                part the Outer Hebrides, the Archipel
                which is located in the Atlantic around
                60 km north west of the shores of
                Scotland. The ocean, cold as ice,
                presents itself in all shades of blue,
                reaching from a light blue to a royal
                blue then an hysterical cyan which
                fades into a grey blue while its white
                froth drapes itself around the rocky
                coastline. The ceaseless roaring of the
                wind covers the landscape like a
                blanket. Trees and bushes are a rare
                find but, surprisingly, the odd palm tree
                pops up now and again in some of the
                front yards across the island.
                Vegetation is limited on the Outer
                Hebrides as peat, moors and the naked,
                black, shimmering red rocks take centre
                stage on this barren land.
                <br>
                Alongside the capital city of Stornaway,
                hamlets and little courtyards are found
                scattered across the island. The
                characteristic monotonous architecture
                made up of sandy brown and grey
                waterproof concrete is functional not
                designer based. On occasion though, a
                bright yellow or red rooftop will peek out
                from the mossy brown landscape.
                <br>
                In our photo book “Lewis and Harris” we,
                Vianca Reinig and Philipp Schmidt,
                focus on that exact landscape and the
                surroundings of the Outer Hebrides. In a
                series of landscape photographs you
                will get an insight into the ancient,
                rough beauty of the landscape with its
                organic shapes and colours.
                Complementing these is a selection of
                architectural photographs
                concentrating on the functional
                elements of the surroundings which are
                made and used by the people who call
                these archaic surroundings their home.
                <br>
                The photographs are in chronological
                order without gaps and ending in on
                the mid line of each page, the next
                merging over the bind to complete the
                next page. There are no breaks. Colour,
                light and landscape change rapidly,
                almost resembling a movie. By
                constantly altering the perspectives,
                from wide distance landscape shots to
                focus on small details, it mirrors how
                one experiences these landscapes
                whilst travelling. Occasionally some
                photographs are rotated against the
                horizon or cut off to emphasize the
                dynamic movement. <br> <br>
                The observer is taken on a journey,
                moving across the county along with
                the book. <br> <br>
